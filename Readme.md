# Backend Development -> Video Hosting Website

## Tech Stack:- 
       - Express, MongoDB, NodeJs , Javascript 
       -  For Secure tokens : jwt (jsonwebtoken)
       - For Upload files/middleware  - multer
       - For image uploading (Cloudinary)

### This is a backend project with features like YouTube (login, register/signup, like, share, subscribe ...)

For backend development of a video hosting website, that covers various aspects such as server setup, database management, API creation, and file handling. 

<h2> Here’s a high-level overview <h2>

<h3> Server Setup: </h3>
       Instructions on configuring the server environment, installing the necessary software, and setting up Node.js with Express.js to handle server requests.
<h3>Database Management:</h3>  Guidance on using MongoDB with Mongoose for database operations, including schema design, data modeling, and CRUD operations.

<h3> API Endpoints:</h3> Creating RESTful API endpoints with Express.js, including request handling, response formatting, and route protection.
<h3>
File Uploads:
</h3> Procedures for implementing file upload functionality using Multer, and integrating with Cloudinary for video storage and optimization. Before uploading to cloud , use multer middleware to verify the file upload properly.

<h3>Security:</h3>

   - used jwt, bcrypt libraries

<h3>Error Handling:</h3>
       ->  Strategies for robust error handling and logging to ensure reliability and ease of debugging.
 
<p>
This endeavor is an intricate backend initiative, constructed utilizing Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, among other technologies. We’re in the process of developing a full-fledged video hosting platform, akin to YouTube, equipped with a complete suite of features including user registration, video uploading, likes, dislike, comments, replying, subscribe, and unsubscribing, and notifications,further, we can add - other futures -> join, thumbnail, share and goes on...
